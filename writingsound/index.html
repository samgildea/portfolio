<p>For this project I wanted to try and capture a very specific aspect of my life, computer programming.  There are many sounds that I find are very unique to the atmosphere of when I am writing a computer program.  From the sounds of frantically typing on a keyboard,  to the sound of my coffee machine brewing coffee with the sounds of my computer overheating as the fan turns on.  My goal was to combine these sounds in a way that allowed me to fully convey what it sounds like when I am computer programming.  I wanted to truly capture and produce a field recording of what it sounds like when I am debugging code both inside and outside of my brain. 
</p>
<p>One thing that I really wanted to convey throughout this piece was the overall environment of programming on a computer.  It reminded me a lot of reading about Ludwig Göransson capturing the environment of Wakanda when he was working on the score of Black Panther.  Given that I spend hours each day writing code on my computer, this is an environment that I was very familiar with and something I knew exactly how the energy and overall atmosphere had to feel. 
</p>
<p>
  The most interesting thing that I found about when creating this project was when I was working studying the sound of my mechanical keyboard when I was typing.  When I was programming, the sounds of typing were much more aggressive and sporadic.  There would be quick bursts of fast typing followed by a pause.   After recording myself typing I started to realize that a lot of my typing while I was programming was following a very specific rhythm.  Immediately I realized I wanted to build the entire piece around the very rhythmic and percussive sound of me loudly typing on my keyboard. 
</p>
<p> 
  I think in many ways I was expressing my self when I was typing.  The way I type is very indicative to how my brain works when I am problem solving while I am programming.  I wanted to try and represent the way I think in the overall composition of this piece.  Another thing I really wanted to add was the sound of coffee.  In many ways coffee is a very large part of my overall self when I am programming because typically I spend a lot of time debugging my code and the energy the caffeine from the coffee really helps me focus. 
  I added the sound effect of my coffee machine brewing a cup of coffee and overlayed 
</p>
<p> 
  One of the hardest parts I noticed was trying to represent the energy and overall feeling I get when I am frustrated programming.  I wanted to convey my thought process and how it feels when I am stuck on a bug while programming.  I wanted people to be able to have a window into my mind when I am programming.  That was the overall energy I wanted to show with this piece.  
</p>

<p> 
  When I was trying to record this piece it reminded me heavily of Steven Feld talking about recording the toads.  My mechanical keyboard and the very amplified loud sound of each key slamming on the keyboard was very "acousticly rich".  In addition, the sound of my coffee machine had a very full and acoustic sound when it was brewing and dispensing the coffee.  The environment of both my coffee machine paired with the sound of my mechanical keyboard was something I didn't realize captured my thoughts and energy as I was programming.  It was almost as if my keyboard and my coffee machine was speaking to each other as the noises followed very similar patterns. Both my keyboard and my coffee machine had pauses in between making the sounds which helped me understand what Feld meant when he described the toads making noises and interacting with each other.  
</p>

<p> 
  The one thing that I really wanted to capture was the chaos of frantically trying to debug a program. It is a very amazing when my mind is running as fast as my keyboard and I feel like my brain is going to explode.  I wanted to put the frustration of trying to program in this piece.  The way I did this was on top of the sound effects of me programming I wanted to add some electronic noises that in my mind represented a computer.  I wanted to combine the inner confusion of my mind with the electronic sounds representing a computer.  
  I managed to achieve this by using a software that replicates a modular synthesizer.  Then I managed to use an arpegiator plugin to randomize the notes being played.  I wanted the noise to be as random as possible to express my mindset when I am frustrated programming. </p>

  
  <p> In the end,  by using some of the readings on Ludwig Göransson, and Steven Feld I believe I was able to capture the environment and mental state of me programming.  Overall, I believe what I was able to do was portray my mind and the soundss that are most common while I computer programming for hours.</p>
