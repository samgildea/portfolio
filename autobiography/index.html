        <p> &nbsp; Music plays a massive role in my life for many reasons.   It is something that I constantly seek out and research more than anything else.  Music has given me a community of some of best friends and has allowed to meet me people from all different backgrounds and different parts of the world.  In addition, music is also something that I pursue with all my non-musical passions such as computer science and fashion.  
  </p>
        <br>
        <p> &nbsp; Music has always played a very important role throughout my adolescence.  I did not attend a traditional high school and rather pursued a competitive snowboard career.  Due to the constant travelling for snowboarding, I attended high school online.   This non-traditional high school experience left me without a traditional high school community.  My community outside of snowboarding was entirely formed through music.  </p>
        <br>
        <p> &nbsp; In particular, the community I felt the strongest connection to was the fanbase behind my favorite artist, Bladee and the swedish music collectives drain gang/sadboys, comprised of rappers Yung Lean, Bladee and Ecco2k with producers Yung Sherman, Whitearmor and Gud.  Part of the reason why I felt such a strong connection to this community is the online community that surrounds these artists.  These artists do not share too much about them and are very secretive with the way they execute their creative ideas.  This leads the fanbase to use websites such as Reddit to discover and learn more about these artists.  </p>
        <br>
        <p> &nbsp; After falling in love with Bladee’s music I began to become an active member in the Sadboy’s Reddit community to connect with other passionate fans of Bladee and the members of Drain Gang.   While spending time in airports travelling the world to different snowboard competitions, I would constantly be contributing to this community online.  From pictures of Bladee on the runway of various fashion shows, to sharing leaked snippets of unreleased songs that Bladee was working on, I was obsessed with the music, the aesthetic and the fanbase of him.  </p>
        <br>
        <p> &nbsp; While I may have never had a traditional high school community and group of friends, I am blessed to have the community behind my favorite artist.  This community introduced me to fashion designers and other musicians that I would never have otherwise gotten access too if I hadn’t been so involved and active within the Sadboys community.  Bladee has introduced to me fashion designers such as Rick Owens and artists such as the techno producer Varg.   </p>
        <br>
        <p> &nbsp; Since Bladee and his collective are originally from Sweden, he has a massive European following.  This has given me the opportunity to connect with many fans from different parts of the world online.  Many of his fans get to witness him live much more than I do and have the opportunity to ask him questions and share those with the worldwide community.  Since Bladee does not promote his music in a traditional way and it sometimes make it’s very hard to discover when he is releasing music or appearing in various fashion events.  Thus, the community typically indirectly promotes his music when they discover more about what he is doing. </p>
        <br>
        <p> &nbsp; Finally,  outside of Bladee, something that I am most passionate about is computer science.  I have been able to combine computer science and music in multiple ways.  For example,  two years after his debut album, Eversince, Bladee announced his sophomore album Redlight.  Given how well-received Eversince was with Bladee fans, members of the Bladee fan base became highly anticipating Redlight’s release.  </p>
        <br>
        <p> &nbsp; Nonetheless, in typical Bladee fashion, the lack of promotion surrounding his second album was very little.  Therefore, I decided to take matters into my owns hand.  I coded a website with a countdown to the release of his album with photos and the first few singles he released embedded into the website.  After releasing this website,  Bladee fans began to reach out to me, thanking me for making this website.  </p>
        <br>
        <p> &nbsp; After combining my love for computer science to promote one of my favorite artists, this opened up a community of fans that allowed to me express what I anticipated sonically for the album.  It made the anticipation to the release of this album much more exciting, with me being able to communicate and listen to other fans what they were hoping the album would sound like.  </p>
        <br>
        <p> &nbsp; In the end, it is hard not to get emotional when thinking about how impactful and defining music has been in my life.  Through my favorite artist, Bladee, I have gained access to a community and friends from across the world.  As someone that has never attended high school,  it is pretty amazing to think about the oppurtunities and people I have met through music and more specifically, the Sadboy’s and Drain Gang community.</p>
